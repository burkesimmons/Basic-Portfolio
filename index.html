			<img src="assets/images/person.jpg" alt="Burke Simmons" id="bio-image">

			<p>I am a 40 year old male native to Utah. I was born in Provo. I moved to Elgin, Illinois (with my parents...obviously) before entering kindergarten. Then we took a big trip to Hawaii! We lived on Oahu in Kalama Valley until I was almost finished with the 5<sup>th</sup> grade. Then paradise came to a halt and we were back in my birth state, enjoying snow once again.</p>
		
			<p>I married my high school sweetheart, Jenni, in 2001. We have had three children since then. The oldest, Kaleb, is 15. Our 2<sup>nd</sup>, Kaiya, is 13. And our youngest, Katelin, is 10 years old. These kids keep us busy and make us happy.</p>
